# Day 15

🎯 Day 15 – One Project a Day Until I Get Hired

📈 5 Data Insights in Python (Jupyter Notebook Edition)

Today I shifted from Excel to Python and explored the Superstore dataset in a Jupyter notebook — combining pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn to uncover and visualize five key business insights.


✅ What I did:

  - Cleaned and prepped the dataset (handled missing postal codes)

  - Parsed and formatted date fields for analysis

  - Generated 5 practical insights with clear visuals
    

📊 Insights:

  1. Top 5 Customers by Revenue – Who's driving the most sales?

  2. Most Profitable Categories – Which product lines perform best?

  3. Monthly Sales Trend – Clear upward patterns in certain seasons

  4. Average Delivery Time – Distribution of shipping delays

  5. States with Most Orders – Where demand is highest geographically


🛠️ Tools used: Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

💡 The goal was to replicate real-world data exploration and storytelling — all in under 2 hours.
